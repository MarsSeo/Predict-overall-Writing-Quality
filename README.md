## Introduction

This project is centered around an intriguing competition that sought to predict overall writing quality through the analysis of typing behavior and process features. Spanning from October 3, 2023, to January 10, 2024, the competition presented a unique blend of data science and linguistic study. The primary objective was to create a model trained on extensive keystroke log datasets, highlighting different facets of the writing process. This approach aimed to unravel the complex relationship between various writing behaviors and the resultant quality of written essays.

## Background

The competition was more than a mere exercise in predictive modeling. It delved into the intricate web of behavioral actions and cognitive activities inherent in the writing process. Writers employ diverse techniques for planning, revising, and executing their work, each leaving distinct patterns in their writing, such as pauses, additions, deletions, and revisions. While traditional assessments of writing quality focus predominantly on the final product, this competition aimed to shine a light on the journey towards that end.

The challenge was to use process features from keystroke log data to predict overall writing quality. This task not only had the potential to uncover new insights into learnersâ€™ writing behaviors but also to enhance current writing assessment tools, which mainly focus on final written products. Ultimately, this could lead to more effective teaching strategies, fostering students' autonomy, metacognitive awareness, and self-regulation in writing.
